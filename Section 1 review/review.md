- Categories have objects and morphisms.
- Every object has an identity morphism to itself.
- Morphisms obey associativity, crucially, this means that if there is a morphism between any two objects a and b, and a morphism between b and any c, then there is a morphism between a and c.
- Functors are morphisms between categories
- Natural transformations are morphisms between functors
- Because functors and Natural Transformations obey associativity rules, they themselves form categories of their constituent categories, thereby becoming members of Cat, the category of small categories
