1. Why do we need the commutativity condition for all triangles linking any two cones for the unviersal cone construction?
2. What is the significance of "Commutativity conditions" and why does it allow us to ignore morphisms?
3. I'm still confused about the definition and significance of contravariant functors and hom-functors.
4. Why aren't all morphisms in the hom-set C(c, LimD). the special factoring morphism between cone c and the LimD?
