- external hom-sets vs. internal hom-sets
- there is no function type in a category without a product for all pairs of objects
- universal function object in set is the hom-set of a -> b
- currying emerges from the universal function object applied to morphisms on a product whereby the universal function object can be applied to the first argument and return a function parameterized over the second.
- category theory helps define a framework over functions of two arguments, partially applied functions, and function over a pair mostly via. the universal product.
- currying is the factorizer for the universal construction of the function object.
- identity raised to a (identity) corresponds to the unit function
- exponentials over products correspond to currying
- universal function object corresponds to logical implication via. category theory

"According to the Curry-Howard isomorphism, every type can be
interpreted as a proposition — a statement or a judgment that may
be true or false. Such a proposition is considered true if the type is
inhabited and false if it isn’t. In particular, a logical implication is true
if the function type corresponding to it is inhabited, which means that
there exists a function of that type. An implementation of a function
is therefore a proof of a theorem." wow
