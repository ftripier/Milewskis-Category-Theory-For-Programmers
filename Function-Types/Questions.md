* summarize the chapter


1. What does it really mean to look inside objects? Conversely, let's define the opaque nature of category theoretic objects.

2. In understanding the universal construction of a function application:
  - What makes the pattern they call out special? It's one object with a morphism to another. Is that object actually constructed as product among pairs using the universal product construction?

  yes

3. The significance of universal objects:
  What's the "universe". Does it apply across categories because it's defined as a pattern?

4. Is the idea behind the universal construction of the function that there's a function space that maps to one function between types?

5. Why is the set of all functions from Bool to Int the set of all pairs of Int? Why isn't Bool involved?

6. What's an example of a category without:
  - terminal object
  - initial object
  - product

7. Is the initial object effectively the ahnnialator in algebra or does it not have enough properties?

8. In this chapter we see the author execute a universal construction of the universal function object. How does he know to give it the structure it has as opposed to any other?

9. Functions have three objects, and so aren't morphisms between two objects... Whaaaaaaaaat man?
  - he's talking about function types not functions
