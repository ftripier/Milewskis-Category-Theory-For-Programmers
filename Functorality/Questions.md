1. The book says functors are morphisms in Cat, but didn't it just say Cat wasn't a category because of Russell's paradox?
A: Cat is the category of small categories, and so it doesn't contain itself.

2. Review: Universal Construction

3. I guess the monoid kind of eludes me. My instinct when thinking about some algebra in terms of categories are to biject elements of the set to objects - is this wrong? I know the text went into this a little, but is there some insight where it's easier to understand when something is a monoid?

4. The book says sets are a monoidal category in terms of cartesian product with the singleton set as the unit object. It also says that sets are a monoidal category with respect to disjoint union with the empty set as the unit object. These are seperate objects right?

5. Is the singleton set one object because there's no possible disambiguation between elements? (the exact element isn't important because it can't be compared across sets).

6. Are all parametrized data types functors?

7. So if all algebraic data types are composed of the identity and the constant functor, what's the map of categories look like? Is it all just one category?

8. Why are profunctors and contravariant functors important?
