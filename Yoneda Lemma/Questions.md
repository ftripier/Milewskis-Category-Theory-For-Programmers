> Weâ€™ve seen in the previous section that some Set-valued functors are representable, that is isomorphic to a hom-functor. The Yoneda lemma tells us that all Set-valued functors can be obtained from hom-functors through natural transformations, and it explicitly enumerates all such transformations.

If only some set-valued functors are representable, how can all Set-valued functors be obtained from hum-functors through natural transformations?

A) The yoneda lemma simply talks about how to derive natural transformations _from_ the hom-set to set valued functors, not necessarily just the invertible ones.

2. What does it mean to have a function f from C(a, a) to C(a, y)?

A) I guess it must mean a function f, that is also in the homset C(a, y)? This doesn't really make any sense to me.
