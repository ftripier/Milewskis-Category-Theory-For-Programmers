- via the Yoneda Lemma, any Set valued functor is representable (naturally isomorphic to the hom-set functor)
- the Yoneda lemma works by specifying a natural transformation at one point, and proves it applies to all points.
- The yoneda lemma states:
There is a one-to-one correspondence between natural transformation from the hom-set functor to any set-valued functor F, and the image of the set valued functor applied to the hom-sets base object.
- The Yoneda Lemma exploits the naturality square between an arbitrary set-valued functor f and the hom-set functor, by using the point-wise introspective capabilities of functions on set once in the co-domain (of set). In particular, the Yoneda lemma uses C(a, a), and chooses one morphism h to act as the studied natural transformation component. This morphism h must be equivalent to id-a.
- Plugged into the naturality condition, the new equation is
a^y(f) = (F(f))(a^a(id^a))

Where f is an arbitrary element of the hom-set functors image. Any point in F(a) will define some natural transformation.
