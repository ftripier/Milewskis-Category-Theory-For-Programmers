- via the Yoneda Lemma, any Set valued functor is representable (naturally isomorphic to the hom-set functor)
- the Yoneda lemma works by specifying a natural transformation at one point, and proves it applies to all points.
- The yoneda lemma states:
There is a one-to-one correspondence between natural transformation from the hom-set functor to any set-valued functor F, and the image of the set valued functor applied to the hom-sets base object.
