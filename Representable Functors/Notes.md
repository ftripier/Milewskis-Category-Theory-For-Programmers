- Sometimes, studying a cetegory theoretic problem by functors to the category of sets is an easier/more insightful way to solve it, presumably because sets are lower level and thus more introspective.

- Every category has multiple possible functors to Set

- One functor maps an object to its own hom set (the reader functor)

- Varying the other argument leads to a contravariant functor (the op functor)

- the hom-set functor is a representation of the category in Set. Functors that are naturally isomorphic to the hom-set functor are called "representable functors".
