1. if you preserve multiplication, you maintain the following relation
  h (a * b) = h a * h b

  if you didn't preserve unit, you'd have some multiplication with the unit in the original monoid h(a * e) = a that is mapped to
  h (a * b) = c. Element c in the target monoid would have to be mapped back to a in order for an isomorphism to exist, but that means that b could only be the unit, otherwise c would have a non unit factor and would break invertability.
2.
a) The image of the empty list should just be the empty element for multiplication, so 1.
b) the image of [1, 2, 3, 4] should be 24.
c) all the factorings of 12 map to it. So:
[12, 1*], [4, 3, 1*], [6, 2, 1*]
d) I guess you could map a singleton list [x] to any integer, as long as you have a bijection. I'm not sure if that counts.

3. The free monoid generated by the one element set is just all lists of length n : N (the set of natural numbers). Basically, all repitions of the element. I'm not sure what is specifically the most interesting isomorphism, or what ordering relation there could be among them, but I thought of a few isomorphisms:

* natural numbers through length
* natural numbers through addition
* integers via diagnolization
* rational numbers via diagnolization
* exponentials
