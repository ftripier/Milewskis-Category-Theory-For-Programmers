- natural transformations operate between functions
- natural transformations are a way of defining morphisms between functors
- a natural transformation releis on morphisms present in the embedded category
- natural transformations map objects in the image by relying on morphisms present between them.
- natural transformations map morphisms [my understanding here needs some refinement]
- functors correspond to type constructors that map types to other types. They must also map the object's morphisms (function to function), and therefore must implement fmap.
- paramtrically polymorphic functions between two functors are always natural transformations. In Haskell, this means any polymorphic functions between types is a natural transformation.
